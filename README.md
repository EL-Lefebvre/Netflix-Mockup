This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.

## CONCEPT

This is project is a mockup of the streaming platform Netflix using
React,Typescript, Material UI, NodeJs and the MovieDB API. Eventually, I would like to deploy this
project on Netlify to have a fully functioning website.

Basically, just like Netflix, this project will list in a carousel format
the different categories of movies and a suggestion of random movies at the
top( The "most recent added"). We'll be calling an API in order to list these movies
(https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/lists)

After this is completed, I would like to allow user to be able to create,
sign in and keep in a database their favorite movies. We will be using
MongoDB as a noSQL database and Mongoose for the sign in logic.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm i`

Run in order to install all the necessary dependencies.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
